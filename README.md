# MyReads Project

A React application that allows users to search for awesome books, and add them to shelves according to Currently reading, Want to read and Read.

## Pre-requisite

 - [Git](https://git-scm.com)
 - [Node](https://nodejs.org)

## Setting up environment
1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start application: `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
